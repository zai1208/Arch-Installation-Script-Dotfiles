# Dotfiles
> [!CAUTION]
> The dotfiles have not been uploaded yet so this script is not yet ready for production

The dotfiles are installed by the script as well and are stored to `~/dotfiles/`

My dotfiles also contain a font `HackNerdFontMono-Regular.ttf` which is my preferred font for alacritty
