# Arch-Installation-Script-Dotfiles
This is my personal Arch Installation script (it also installs my dotfiles)

install using `curl -sSL https://tinyurl.com/zai1208-arch | sh` after connecting to internet and syncing date & time

# Dotfiles
> [!NOTE]
> My waybar dotfiles have not been uploaded yet (they are based on the ml4w dotfiles)

The dotfiles (found [here](https://github.com/zai1208/dotfiles)) are installed by the script as well and are stored to `~/dotfiles/`

They include an Endeavour OS wallpaper
