# Arch-Installation-Script-Dotfiles
This is my personal Arch Installation script (it also installs my dotfiles)

> [!WARNING]
> This is still filled with bugs so don't use it yet

install using `bash <(curl -sSL https://tinyurl.com/zai1208-arch)` after connecting to internet and running `fdisk -l` to find the name of your disk

Note that this script takes a long time to install (~40 minutes) so you may want to get a coffee or something after the initial prompts

# Dotfiles
> [!NOTE]
> My waybar dotfiles have not been uploaded yet (they are based on the ml4w dotfiles)

My dotfiles (found [here](https://github.com/zai1208/dotfiles)) are installed by the script as well and are stored to `~/dotfiles/`

They include an Endeavour OS wallpaper
